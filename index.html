            Description: Zenko-ji Temple, dating back to the 7th century, is one of Japan's most significant and popular
            temples. It houses the first Buddhist statue brought into Japan during Buddhism's introduction in the 6th
            century. While the original statue remains hidden, a copy is displayed to the public every six years for a
            few weeks. The next viewing opportunity is expected in 2028. Zenko-ji played a crucial role in Nagano's
            development, as the city grew around this temple of great importance.

            <br>
            Description: The Jigokudani Monkey Park offers a unique experience of observing wild monkeys bathing in a

            forests of the Jigokudani valley in Yamanouchi, near the onsen towns of Shibu and Yudanaka.
            <br>
            <br>
            The park features a man-made pool where monkeys gather, just a short walk from the entrance. Monkeys can be
            seen along the path to the pool, living in large social groups. It's quite entertaining to watch their
            interactions, as they're accustomed to human presence and mostly ignore their visitors. However, touching or
            feeding the monkeys is strictly prohibited.
